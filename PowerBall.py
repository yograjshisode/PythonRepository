'''To win the Powerball lottery (an extremely unlikely event so don't waste your time) you have to pick six numbers
correctly. The first five numbers are drawn from a drum containing 53 balls and the sixth is drawn from a drum containing
 42 balls. The chances of doing this are 1 in 120,526,770. Write a program to generate a set of Powerball numbers by
 utilizing the choice function in Python's random module.'''
